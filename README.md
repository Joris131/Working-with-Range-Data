### If the protein coding feature is on the forward strand, the nucleotide sequence underlying this range is the mRNA created during transcription. In contrast, if the protein coding feature is on the reverse strand, the reverse complement of the nucleotide sequence underlying this range is the mRNA sequence created during transcription.
