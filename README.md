# Working-with-Range-Data

### If the protein coding feature is on the forward strand, the nucleotide sequence underlying this range is the mRNA created during transcription. In contrast, if the protein coding feature is on the reverse strand, the reverse complement of the nucleotide sequence underlying this range is the mRNA sequence created during transcription.

## Dealing with factors in rangers(the ranges we create in R are facotors, not dataframes):

    str(the_name_of_the_factor) #similar to Level(), to access the a factor's levels
